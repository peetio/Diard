## Diard
Diard is a document image analysis pipeline which extracts semi-structured Analysis Ready Data from your Document's Images. To achieve this, a state-of-the-art layout detection model is used ([DiT](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/dit)) to extract document objects (i.e., title, text, list, figure,...). These objects are then used to segment the sections (i.e., Table Of Contents, Introduction,...) and to find the information needed to obtain a semi-structured version of your document.
